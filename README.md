# Toggle-style Checkboxes

I read an [article on LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/5-things-you-can-do-with-css-instead-of-javascript/) about some CSS tricks, and was inspired by the author's use of a checkbox in one of the examples (the darkmode one). I decided to implement it myself as a quasi-Android-style sliding toggle switch and was successful. I also added styling to change the label that's displayed when the toggle is on vs off.
